      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Our project explores the fascinating intersection of artificial life, evolutionary computation, and reinforcement learning by developing an adaptive ecosystem simulation. In this simulation, virtual agents inhabit a dynamic environment and exhibit both intra-lifetime learning and inter-generational evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core objective is to investigate how artificial agents can adapt intelligently within complex environments by leveraging the combined power of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Each agent learns to survive, reproduce, and cooperate—or compete—using decision-making capabilities informed by both sensory perception and internal state monitoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally prototyped in Unity, the system was re-engineered in Python using PyTorch to leverage GPU acceleration and scalability. The final platform supports real-time visualization, large population simulations, and detailed performance tracking, serving as a reusable research tool for the AI community.

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Our research addresses a central question in artificial intelligence and artificial life:
        <em>Can agents that both evolve and learn outperform those that rely on only one adaptation mechanism?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To answer this, we designed an artificial ecosystem populated by autonomous agents. Each agent is equipped with two neural processing units:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that interprets spatial sensory inputs such as food distribution, hazards, and nearby agents.</li>
        <li>A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that processes internal states like health, reproduction status, and social metrics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These inputs are fused and fed into a Q-learning-based decision module, allowing agents to learn optimal actions such as moving, foraging, fleeing, or reproducing. Across generations, agents undergo selection, crossover, and mutation using a Genetic Algorithm. This dual approach enables them to adapt both over time and in real-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid learning framework significantly enhances survival, behavioral richness, and resilience to environmental change.
